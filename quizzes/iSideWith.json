        "description": "The Syrian Civil war began in the spring of 2011 after nationwide protests against the government of President Bashar al-Assad resulted in armed conflict. After rebels seized control of several major cities, ISIS forces moved in and took over control of many regions of northern Syria. The government of Assad responded by carrying out airstrikes resulting in over 70,000 civilian deaths. Proponents of overthrowing Assad argue that he is a brutal dictator who must be removed from power before he carries out any more atrocities on innocent Syrian civilians. Opponents of regime change, including President Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, argue that removing Assad will result in a power vacuum that will destabilize the Middle East.",

The act, proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) would lower the interest rate on existing student loans from 7% to 3.86%. The act would be financed by levying a mandatory income tax of 30% on everyone who earns between $1 Million and $2 Million dollars per year.
